        <p class="direction">_[in the doorway]_.</p> <p>I found a note from you at home. What does this
        mean?</p><br>
        
        <h6 id="n1">MRS LINDE.</h6>
        <p>It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.</p><br>
        
        <h6 id="n1">KROGSTAD.</h6>
        <p>Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?</p><br>
        
        <h6 id="n1">MRS LINDE.</h6>
        <p>It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my
        rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers
        are at the dance upstairs.</p><br>
        
        <h6 id="n1">KROGSTAD.</h6>
        <p class="direction">_[coming into the room]_.</p> <p>Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?</p><br>
        
        <h6 id="n1">LINDE.</h6> 
        <p>Yes, why not?</p><br>
        
        <h6 id="n1">KROGSTAD.</h6> 
        <p>Certainly—why not?</p><br>
